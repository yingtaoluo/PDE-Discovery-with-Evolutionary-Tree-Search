# PDE-Discovery-with-Neural-Evolutionary-Tree-Search
This algorithm can efficiently establish mathematical equation with tree representation to fit existing dataset. We can discover partial derivative equation (PDE) up to 3 orders effectively and even discover some forms of varying coefficient PDE.  
There is another work of us that uses novel nonparametric sparse regression for the data mining of PDE, which can solve nearly any PDEs, even with the most complicated forms. We hope to publish the code ASAP after our conference paper is accpeted.
