# PDE-Discovery-with-Evolutionary-Tree-Search
De novo Discovery of Partial Derivative Equations with Evolutionary Tree Search. The paper is submitted to a journal. All rights reserve.   
This algorithm can efficiently establish mathematical equation with tree representation to fit existing dataset. We can discover partial derivative equation (PDE) up to 3 orders effectively and even discover some forms of varying coefficient PDE.  
There is another work of us that uses novel nonparametric sparse regression for the data mining of PDE. We hope to publish the code ASAP after our conference paper is accpeted.
